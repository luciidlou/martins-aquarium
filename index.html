        <aside class="right">
            <h2 class="subtitle">Tank Maintenence</h2> 
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Use the right size tank</h4>
                <p>First, be sure your tank is the proper size for the fish you keep. If your tank is too small, the 
                    fish will be stressed and the tank will get dirty much faster. Your tank should not be overly large, however, or 
                    the fish will be uncomfortable and it will be much more space to keep clean</p>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Change the Water Regularly</h4>
                <p>Slight water changes on a regular schedule can help keep your tank clean by removing dirty, spent 
                    water and replacing it with clean water. To keep the tank balanced and your fish comfortable, only 
                    change 10-20 percent of the water every 2-3 weeks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Trim Plants</h4>
                <p>Live plants can be beautiful and functional accents in your fish tank, providing places for bashful fish to hide and 
                    offering a natural source of nutrition. If you notice any leaves or grasses turning brown or decaying, however, trim 
                    those dead bits away to keep the tank clean.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Scrape the Glass</h4>
                <p>Algae can easily be removed from the sides of your tank with a simple scraper or razor blade. Scrape the sides regularly 
                    to keep algae growth to a minimum and you’ll more easily be able to see all the colors and details of your tank.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Feed Your Fish Appropriately</h4>
                <p>Offer your fish the highest quality food so their digestion will be more efficient, and only feed them the proper amount 
                    of food on a strict schedule. Any food uneaten after 5-10 minutes should be strained out and removed so it does not foul 
                    the tank.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Clean Props</h4>
                <p>Props such as rocks, logs, castles, sunken ships, and other accents can add a bit of structure and whimsy to your tank, but 
                    they don’t look nearly as nice if they’re covered with algae. Rinse them with hot water and wipe them off to remove algae 
                    buildup and keep them clean.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Vacuum the Gravel</h4>
                <p>Fish feces, shed scales, uneaten food, dead bits of plants, and other debris will settle to the bottom of your tank. Vacuuming 
                    the gravel every week will remove much of this debris and refresh the tank, brightening the gravel and keeping the tank 
                    healthier.</p>
            </div>

                <h4>Water Salinity</h4>
                <p>Saltwater aquarium salinity is usually kept between 1.020-1.028sg. Some aquarists like to keep fish only aquariums 
                    at lower levels (1.017+) to keep salt costs low and to reduce problems with parasites, which don't survive as well 
                    in lower salinity.</p>
